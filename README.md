# NGINX Build Script

This is an NGINX build script which compiles NGINX with a statically linked version of OpenSSL. It's been tested to work on a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B running Raspbian Jessie Lite. However, it should also work on other Debian-based Linux distros. 

This is based on the [build_nginx.sh](https://gist.github.com/MattWilcox/402e2e8aa2e1c132ee24) script from [@MattWilcox](https://github.com/MattWilcox). You can find more details about this at his [blog post](https://mattwilcox.net/web-development/setting-up-a-secure-website-with-https-and-spdy-support-under-nginx-on-a-raspberry-pi).
